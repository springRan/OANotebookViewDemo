OANotebookViewDemo

Drawing with Quartz
---------------------

This purpose of this app is to demostrate the use of Quartz to do some drawing in the drawRect method, which is fast and usually will be very memory safe.

OANotebookView is a subclass of UIView with the drawRect method overloaded to create the look and feel of a notebook sheet of paper, with horizontal 
blue lines and two paralels red lines.
